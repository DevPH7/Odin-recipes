        <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon lime zest</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon lime zest, or to taste</li>
    </ul>    


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the crust: Mix almond flour, sweetener, coconut flour, lime zest, and salt in a large bowl together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.
             Cut in butter with a fork until combined and no lumps remain. Press crust mixture into the bottom of the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven; keep the oven on</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Whisk lime juice, coconut milk, sweetener, melted butter, and lime zest in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Mix until sweetener is dissolved; do not let boil.
             Gradually add beaten eggs, whisking constantly, until mixture is foamy and airy and starts to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove filling from the heat and spread evenly over the crust.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until filling is set in the middle, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the bars are baking, make the topping: Toast shredded coconut in a small skillet over medium heat until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and toss in lime zest.</li>
        <li>Remove bars from the oven and sprinkle topping over the surface. Let cool for 15 minutes, then transfer to the refrigerator until chilled, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Cut into 12 bars.</li>
    </ol>
